# Apache JMeter
---
JMeter is an open-source software tool designed to perform -
1. Load testing
2. Performance testing
3. Functional testing
of application and services. 

It allows you to simulate heavy user loads and measure the system's performance under different scenarios. 

In simple terms, JMeter helps you answer questions like:
1. How well does my website or application handle a large number of users simultaneously?
2. What is the response time of my API when 1000 requests are made per second?
3. Can my server handle a certain number of connection without slowing down?

JMeter works by simulating user behavior and generating HTTP, HTTPS, or other protocol based requests to your application or service. It measures the 
- response times
- throughput 
- resource utilization of the system under the test.
  
The system under the test is also referred to as SUT.
It can also perform assertions to validate the correctness of the responses.

Here are some key features and uses of JMeter:

1. Load Testing:
	- JMeter helps you determine how well your system performs under heavy loads.
	- By simulating multiple concurrent users, it measures response times, identifies performance bottlenecks, and provides insights into into the system's scalability.
2. Performance testing: 
	- JMeter allows you to assess the performance of your system under various conditions. 
	- You can simulate different network speeds, test database performance, analyze server response times, and evaluate system behavior under peak load scenarios.
3. Functional Testing:
	- JMeter can be used for functional testing by sending requests to APIs, web services, or other components of your application. It verifies if the response are correct and conform to excepted behaviors.
4. Distributed Testing: 
	 - JMeter supports distributed testing, where multiple machines can work together to generate a higher load. 
	 - This helps simulate real-world scenarios where users are accessing your system from different locations.
 5. Reporting and analysis:
	 - JMeter provides built-in reporting capabilities to visualize and analyze test results. It generates various types of report including graphs, tables and charts, helping you interpret the performance and make informed decisions.

JMeter is a powerful tool for assessing and improving the 
- performance,
- scalability 
- reliability 
of your applications and services by simulating real world examples.

## Thread Group
The Thread Group is a fundamental element in JMeter that represents a group of virtual users (threads) that will execute your performance test plan. It simulates concurrent users accessing your application or system under test (SUT).

Within a Thread Group, you define the behavior and characteristics of these virtual users.

This includes
	1. Number of Threads
	2. Ramp-up Time
	3. Loop Count
	4. Scheduler


1. Number of Threads: 
	- This defines the total number of virtual users or threads that will be created to simulate simultaneous requests to your SUT. 
	- Each thread represents a single user.

2. Ramp-up Time:
	- It specifies the time taken to start all the threads or users defined in the Thread Group.
	- For example, if you have 100 threads and a ramp-up time of 10 seconds, JMeter will start 10 threads per second until all 100 threads are active.

3. Loop Count:
	 - This determines the number of times each thread will execute the test plan.
	 - For example, if you set loop count to 5, each thread will execute the test plan five times.

4. Scheduler: 
	 - The scheduler allows you to define the duration of your test plan execution or set specific start and end times. 
	 - This is useful when you want to run tests for a specific time period or during specific hours.


By configuring these within the Thread Group, you can control -
- concurrency 
- load
- duration 
of your performance test.
